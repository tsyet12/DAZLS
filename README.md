# Instructions
1. The "combined_data" folder contains the raw data. (Example data is provided)
2. Use PrepData.py to preprocess data from "combined_data" and save it in "prep_data" folder.
3. After running PrepData.py the preprocessed data with metadata can be found in prep_data folder.
4. Run Model.py to test the DAZLS model.
